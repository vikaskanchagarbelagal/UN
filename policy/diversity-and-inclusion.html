      <h2>1. Our Commitment</h2>
      <p>At Untitled Needleworks, we aren't just building a fashion tech platform; we're building a new table. We believe the best ideas come from the intersection of different perspectives, backgrounds, and experiences. </p>
      <p>Our commitment is to build a team that reflects the diversity of the world we live in, and to foster a culture where everyone— regardless of race, ethnicity, gender identity, sexual orientation,age, ability, religion, or background—feels they belong and can do their best work.</p>

    <section id="hiring">
      <h2>2. Our Hiring Philosophy</h2>
      <p>Talent is everywhere, but opportunity is not. We are actively working to create an equitable and inclusive hiring process. This includes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Writing job descriptions that are inclusive and free of biased language.</li>
        <li>Committing to a structured, skills-based interview process.</li>
        <li>Actively sourcing talent from under represented communities.</li>
        <li>Valuing non-traditional backgrounds and self-taught skills.</li>
      </ul>
      <blockquote>
        This is why our careers page invites you to apply even if you don't see an open role. We believe in your skills and talent, not just a predefined checklist.
      </blockquote>

    <section id="culture">
      <h2>3. Our Culture</h2>
      <p>We are dedicated to making inclusion a daily practice. This means:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Promoting flexible work arrangements to support different life needs.</li>
        <li>Ensuring our digital and physical spaces are accessible.</li>
        <li>Encouraging open dialogue and providing channels for feedback.</li>
        <li>Investing in continuous learning for our team on topics of bias and allyship.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="accountability">
      <h2>4. Accountability</h2>
      <p>This is a journey, not a destination. We hold ourselves accountable for making progress and will remain transparent in our efforts. We welcome feedback from our team and our community on how we can improve.</p>
